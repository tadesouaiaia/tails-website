POPout comes with example data for multiple toy traits: 
`data/toy_height.pop`, `data/toy_bmi.pop`, `data/toy_wbc.pop`, and `data/toy_vol.pop`. 

Each toy data file is in "POP format" which is column or comma separated data where the 
first column is the phenotype and the second column is the PRS values.  For more information 
on POP format and help getting your own data into POP format please see 
own data, see [Guide: Input Data](guide_input.md).
