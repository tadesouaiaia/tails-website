## Python Requirements

Python3+ can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  POPout relies on the numpy, scipy, 
and statsmodels libraries for computation and the matplotlib library for plotting. 

!!! tip "To use the python3 executable on the terminal, type the following command from within the directory:"
    ``` 
    chmod +x POPout.py
    ```
    before proceeding


## NumPy 

NumPy is a free, open-source Python library for scientific computing.  It can be downloaded 
here: [https://numpy.org/install/](https://numpy.org/install/). 

## SciPy 

SciPy is an open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing. 
It builds on top of NumPy and provides a wide range of functionalities for tasks commonly encountered in science and engineering 
and can be downloaded here [https://scipy.org/](https://scipy.org/). 

## statsmodels

Statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, 
as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.  
It can be downloaded here: [www.statsmodels.org](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
