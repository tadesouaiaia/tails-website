POPout is a software tool to apply the "PRS-on-Phenotype outlier" (POPout) test. The POPout test was developed to test for departures from common-variant 
expectations in the tails of trait distributions. Users with PRS and quantitative trait data on a sample of individuals can use the POPout software here to 
perform the POPout test on single or multiple traits and to produce output files that provide the results and figures for illustration.
